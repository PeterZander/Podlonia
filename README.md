# Podlonia

Podlonia downloads RSS podcasts and sync them to mp3-players. That is all.

This is a quick port I made of an old podcast aggregator I made 
with winforms when "Happy Fish" stopped working.

The database structure is simplistic because it is also ported
from an old manual quick hack to Entity Frameworks.

Porting from winforms to Avalonia was pretty easy, and felt familiar
and less problem generating than working with Xamarin has been.
